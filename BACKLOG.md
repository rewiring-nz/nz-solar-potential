# Backlog

Open work, in priority order. Finished work is in git history. Open items
are also GitHub Issues on the project board
(https://github.com/orgs/rewiring-nz/projects/5); pick up and assign work
there.

Live: data version 64 (28 Oct). 32,838 buildings, 35 regions, 1,424,084
panels, 832.8 GWh a year.

## Ship

- **Audit: still to do in the pipeline.**
  - Panels are packed on the 0.1 m grid as 1.10 x 2.00 m
    (`panel_fitting.py:499`); the real panel is 1.134 x 1.961.
  - Plane-intersection and reflex cuts drift after the first cut
    (`roof_partition.py:1066, 2134`; needs `_reanchor`).
  - Frame rules: a wing under 20 deg gets snapped anyway; `frame_group`
    reassigns faces; `register_frame` votes with faces that stay empty;
    `centre_panels` breaks the shared grid.
  - Coverage kWp uses plan area x kW/m2: low by cos(slope).
  - The region-centre horizon is still a floor under every building's beam
    (the lookup table is built with it).
- **Install cost falls at each size tier** (`economics.js:124`): 7.99 kW
  costs more than 8.0 kW. Needs a pricing call: marginal tiers raise every
  quote; interpolated rates keep the levels.
- **Misread faces may carry the wrong aspect.** v64 racks panels square to
  the walls, but the face's direction used for sun is unchanged. The same
  misread faces (low 6–13° faces read 21–46° across the walls) likely have
  the wrong aspect for yield and the sunny-side rule.
- **Add the face-area check to the deploy gate.** A building should not lose
  roof-face area between builds; today it is a separate run
  (`tools/face_area_check.py`).
- **Re-record the goldens.** Last recorded at v52; the installer-layout
  changes since then are not in them.

## Roof lines

- **Use the better reading.** On Josh's 131 drawn roofs the pipeline's pick
  scores line F 0.537 (48 roofs right); the best candidate it already drew
  scores 0.688 (77). Trusting the photo reading plus overlap-clip-only
  coherence (switches `SOLAR_SELECTED_TRUST`/`MIN_SCORE`,
  `SOLAR_FACET_COHERENCE`) scores 64 roofs / 0.601, but breaks messy
  commercial roofs (12 Stanley St, 42 Suburb St, 4734994, 5372596). No score
  or shape statistic separates good readings from bad. Next: the vision
  referee (`tools/vision_referee.py`) only where the photo and LiDAR readings
  disagree (a few hundred roofs, a few dollars).
- **Composite roofs.** `src/composite_roof.py` (a house as its wings, joined
  with straight valleys) is off (`SOLAR_COMPOSITE_ROOFS`). On 139 Shotover
  houses it explains a median 51 points fewer returns than the current faces.
  Needs proper wing fitting first.
- **Still wrong:** 14 Ballarat St (flat roof cut by skylight strips);
  4725584 (keeps a 148-piece reading); facade-top strips on 4740503's east
  block; 4 Kent St reads as a 14.6° gable in the LiDAR (Josh: flat);
  32 Frankton Rd layout order; 4728022 and 5372844 (stray small faces).
- **Verify:** 13 Plantation Rd (4727237), Kingston counts, and the cases
  awaiting a verdict (`tools/cases.py check`).
- **Open-ended drawn lines:** nine marked roofs need patching for the
  line-extension rule (`tools/patch_labelled.py`).
- **arrowtown_hills** builds 50 buildings and estimates none.

## Obstructions

- **Photo obstruction model in LiDAR towns.** On held-out towns the trained
  model (`data/models/photo_obstruct_v1.pt`) scores object recall 0.68 /
  precision 0.36 against the colour detector's 0.30 / 0.30. It is only used
  where there is no LiDAR. Retrain with the benchmark roofs held out, try it
  as the photo path (or referee for colour blobs) in LiDAR towns, and judge
  on `tools/markup_benchmark.py`. The colour detector draws 2/3 of the false
  obstruction area.
- **Small marks missed.** 97 of 163 small marks are missed (54 have contrast
  under 5 in the photo) and 254 small detections touch no mark. Run
  `tools/obstruction_bench.py` on the VM for all 98 complete roofs.
- **Over-carving:** colour blobs on a clean white flat roof (4725716) and a
  19.5 m² "height" obstruction only 0.15–0.23 m proud (4731172).
- **Obstructions with too few returns to judge** (50% on the CBD sample)
  need a photo check.
- **Watch:** 4735290 places panels over dark rectangles (skylights or
  existing panels).
- **Hips and valleys.** An overreach separated from its true face by roof
  with no returns cannot be judged. Colour-only blobs sitting on the plane at
  a fold are shading, but a flush skylight looks the same to the LiDAR: any
  fix must use the blob's shape or position, not its height. Check real
  roofs with `tools/explain_obstructions.py <id>`.

## Imagery

- **Survey-year photo for markup and image steps.** Measured on 98 roofs:
  more precise (0.335 vs 0.328) but finds a fifth fewer small objects. Retry
  with the vent contrast threshold tuned per photo
  (`SOLAR_MARKUP_FRAME=lidar`, `SOLAR_PIPELINE_PHOTO=reference`).
- **One shift per building is not enough on big roofs.** 32 Frankton Rd
  (4,000 m²) leans unevenly.
- **Eaves.** 6.6–18.8% of roof-height returns fall outside the LINZ
  footprint, by up to 2 m, so roof area is understated. Needs per-edge
  treatment judged against the drawn outlines.

## Model

- **Calibration point.** Re-check the SolarView cloud factor against the
  Queenstown Aero normal.
- **System derate** looks 4–5 points optimistic against PVGIS
  (`src/validate_against_pvgis.py`). A change is a `--yield-only` rebuild.
- **Station mapping outside the Wakatipu.** Low-solar days are mapped onto
  the Queenstown Aero station record only for Queenstown, Glenorchy and
  Kingston. Wanaka and Cromwell are not mapped.
- **NREL Himawari sunlight (optional).** The NSRDB Himawari files are public
  on AWS (2015–2020); range reads of the Queenstown pixels may avoid needing
  an API key. The only route to suburb-level cloud.
- **No-LiDAR towns** (Cromwell, Glenorchy): tell gables from hips with the
  roof-line model on the photo; pick pitch per building type; add Pisa
  Moorings (~450 outlines) if wanted. If these towns grow, retest photo-only
  roof reading on panel counts rather than sunshine.

## Map

- **3D view.** Solids are drawn over the map, so a hill or tree between the
  camera and a building does not hide it. Cars in the DSM stand as blobs.
  The sun simulation shades the ground, not the building meshes.

## Scale

- **Dress rehearsal on one city** (docs/national-rehearsal.md). The fleet
  (`tools/fleet.sh`, `src/gcs_queue.py`) has never run as a fleet. LINZ and
  OpenTopography fetch rates are unknown (`tools/measure_fetch_rate.py`). The
  real region-pack ratio is unmeasured (`src/pack_region.py` prints it).
- **Bucket serving** is untested at national scale.
- **Git history** still holds 2.3 GB of old data. A rewrite needs Josh and
  Cameron to agree, and everyone re-clones.
- **The VM cannot upload** (read-only storage scope), so publishing runs
  from a laptop or the "Build and publish the map" GitHub Action.

## Product

- Email updates (Buttondown) wait until the leaderboard has real change data.

## Standing rules

- Hand-drawn markup always wins over fitted geometry.
- Judge changes by measurement against the markup or by the render, never by
  totals alone.
- Nothing at district scale is built on a laptop. The VM builds; the laptop
  only relays through `tools/deploy_from_vm.sh`.
